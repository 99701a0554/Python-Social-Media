It's strongly recommended to create a virtual environment, either with `virtualenv` or with `conda`. The following paragraph describes how to set-up the environment with `virtualenv`:

    # get the book repo
    git clone https://github.com/bonzanini/Book-SocialMediaMiningPython.git
    cd Book-SocialMediaMiningPython
    # install/upgrade virtualenv
    pip install -U virtualenv
    # create the environment
    virtualenv book_env
    # activate the environment
    source book_env/bin/activate
    # install the Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
